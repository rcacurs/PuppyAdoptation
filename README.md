I am currently satarting to get back int to Android development! And at the right time Jetpack Compose launched
launched in Beta stage. This was perferct timing for me to test to get a grasp on what is happening in android 
development ecosystem.

Currently application is built with two activities, but as I understand it is possible to build same functionality 
in single activity, by switching composables. Very excited to learn more
